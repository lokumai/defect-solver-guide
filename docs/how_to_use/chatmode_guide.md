## 1. What is ChatMode and What Is It Used For?
- ChatMode is a feature in GitHub Copilot Chat that allows you to define custom conversation flows for specific tasks — such as bug localization, code generation, or documentation — using pre-configured input fields and MCP tools.

- Instead of manually typing prompts or slash commands (like /mcp.defect_solver.prompt_find_bug), ChatMode provides a dedicated UI panel with input forms that guide the user through the interaction.

- With ChatMode, the entire experience becomes more structured, user-friendly, and accessible — especially for repetitive or complex tool-based tasks.

**Note:** When using ChatMode, you don’t need to manually call tools using /prompt commands.
The tool is automatically triggered with the values entered into the ChatMode form.
